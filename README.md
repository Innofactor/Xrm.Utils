# Xrm.Utils

Project contains various useful extensions that will help develop CRM-reladed code faster.

The code is organized as three separate assemblies:

* **Innofactor.Xrm.Utils.Common** — most generic extensions that could be used in console applications, working with Dynamics CRM, [XrmToolBox](https://www.xrmtoolbox.com/) plugins, as well as in regular CRM plugins and workflows;
* **Innofactor.Xrm.Utils.Plugin** — classes and extensions specific to the CRM plugins development;
* **Innofactor.Xrm.Utils.Workflow** — classes and extensions specific to the CRM workflows development;
